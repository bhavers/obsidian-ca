# Cognitive Architect Sync plugin for Obsidian

This Obsidian plugin enables downloading of architectures from Cognitive Architect (aka [IBM IT Architect Assistant](https://it.architect-assistant.ibm.com/)) into Obsidian as notes and images. It does require a Personal Token from the Cognitive Architect support team.

## What does it do?

Cognitive Architect is an architecture modeling tool. [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a writing app that enables linking of information (notes). It is highly extensible by plugins.<p/>
This plugin creates Notes in Obsidian of the architectural artifacts from Cognitive Architect. Using the Linking functionality of Obsidian, these Notes can be linked together and combined with other information. The vast Obsidian community plugin ecosystem allows for the integraton of other tools (mindmaps, Excalidraw, drawio, etc.) and functionality (like creating custom views with the Data View plugin). Obsidian Notes are stored locally on the computer in Markdown format.

# How to use

-   Install the plugin from Obsidian: Settings -> Community Plugins -> Browse plugins -> search for "Cognitive Architect Sync" -> Install Plugin.
-   Enable the plugin.
-   In the plugin Settings (1, see screenshot below) enter the Base URL and the Personal Token (contact support for a Personal Token)

## Works better with

The plugin works better when the following plugins are installed and enabled.

-   the Obsdian built-in [Templates](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Templates) functionality<br/>
    Templates define the formating of artificats in Obsdian notes. If no template is provided, a default format is chosen.
-   the Community [Dataview plugin](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/).<br/>
    Enabled the creation of views in your notes (for example a list of requirements associated with an artifact)

To develop your own templates and views see the [Obsidian Example Vault for Dataview Queries](https://github.com/s-blu/obsidian_dataview_example_vault) for examples.

# Features
